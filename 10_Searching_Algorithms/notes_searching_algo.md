# Searching Algorithms

## Linear Search

- Start from the beginning and search one by one
  - indexOf
  - includes
  - find
  - findIndex

### Time Complexity

- For unsorted data: 
  - Best => O(1)
    - find right away
  - Average & Worst => O(N)

## Binary Search

- Much faster than linear search

- *Eliminates half* of the remaining elements at a time

- Only works on *sorted arrays*
