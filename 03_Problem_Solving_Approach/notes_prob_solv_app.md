# Problem Solving Approach

## Algorithm

- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

- Almost everything in programming involves some kind of algorithm

- It is the foundation for being successful problem solving and developer 

## How to Improve

- Devise a plan for solving problems
  - How do you approach the problem?
  - Breaking down the problem

- Master common problem solving patterns

## Step 1 - Understand the Problem

- Restate the problem in my own words

- What are the inputs that go into the problem?

- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
  - Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
  - May not be able to answer this question right away

- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
  - What should I call them (i.e. variable names)?

## Step 2 - Explore Examples

- Coming up with examples can help with understanding the problem better

- Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should

- Start with simple examples

- Progress to more complex examples

- Explore examples with empty inputs

- Explore examples with invalid inputs

## Step 3: Break It Down

- Explicitly write out the steps (general steps)
  - Pseudocode

## Step 4: Solve or Simplify

- Solve the problem if you can

- If you cannot solve the whole problem, start simple and just start writing code
  - Better than not writing code and being stuck

## Step 5: Look Back and Refactor
